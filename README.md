#### Welcome to my writeups of picoCTF challenges.
Here you can find writeups for some of the picoCTF challenges, especially in the forensics category. We will add other categories as soon as possible.

## Goals:
1. Store my writeups for picoCTF challenges
2. Improve my GitHub skills
3. Support beginners in CTF
